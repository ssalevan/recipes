Seekh Kebabs - Grilled minced meat on skewers
---------------------------------------------

Ingredients:

2        lbs   minced/ground meat (lamb/goat/beef/pork) - traditionally lamb
1/4      cup   finely chopped cilantro
1/2            medium onion finely chopped 
2        tbsp  onion powder
1 & 1/2  tbsp  ginger-garlic paste
1/4      tbsp  cumin powder
1/4      tbsp  nutmeg powder
3-4            green chilies finely chopped (depending on taste)
2        tbsp  salt
1/2      tbsp  white pepper powder
1/2      tbsp  ground fenel seeds
1/2      tbsp  garam masala
1/4      tbsp  corriander powder

Optional: 1/4   tbsp  Aamchoor powder (Dried sour mango powder)

Method:

Mix all of them in a bowl. Dont be shy to knead the mixture well. Sit overnight in fridge or for a minimum of 2hrs
If you feel the meat is not balling easily and falling appart use a little onion powder as binding agent
Take a handful of the mixture and slowly pat it along the length of the skewer. So that you have something that
looks like a saisage or like a corn-dog. Grill and serve


##  Thaw to room temp before grilling. 
##  When you think the chicken is done pain it with a mixture of 
    butter+aamchoor(mentioned as optional)+chat masala
